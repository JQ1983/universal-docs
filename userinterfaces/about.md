# About

PowerShell Universal provides two ways of creating User Interfaces: Dashboards and Pages. Dashboards are highly interactive interfaces authored in PowerShell. Pages are simple drag and drop interfaces that can call scripts and APIs.&#x20;

## Dashboards

Dashboards offer a higher level of customization, interactivity and complexity. They are developed using the PowerShell Universal Dashboard module.&#x20;

Some examples of interfaces you can create:&#x20;

* Wizard-like input forms with validation and custom step logic
* Highly interactive tables that can sort, filter, export and page directly from a SQL server
* Continuously updating charts that monitor server performance or resource usage&#x20;
* Web pages that behave much like desktop applications with feedback like modals, notifications and interaction between controls.&#x20;

## Pages

Pages provide a basic method of creating user interfaces with a drag and drop designer. The controls are more limited, and the logic of your interface is limited to scripts or APIs that you have created with PowerShell Universal.&#x20;

Some examples of interfaces you can create:&#x20;

* Simple forms that accept various parameters, return output and display progress
* Charts that display data generated from APIs or scripts&#x20;
* Simple tables that sort, page and export data generated by scripts or APIs.&#x20;

## Which do I use?&#x20;

This will depend on your use case. Pages are much easier to get started with and do not have the learning curve of dashboards. Dashboards are much more robust but will require learning a new PowerShell module to create them.&#x20;

If you are looking to expose simple forms that perform actions, return simple results and display data that has been generated in scripts, then Pages will be for you.&#x20;

If you are looking to create a web interface that is similar to Windows Forms or WPF, then Dashboards are likely what you will want to use.&#x20;
