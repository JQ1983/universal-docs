# Frameworks

Dashboard Frameworks define the PowerShell scripts and JavaScript components that are used to render the dashboard. Additional frameworks, when available, can be added through the Add Framework button from the Dashboard Frameworks page. 

There are two dashboard frameworks built into PSU. Universal Dashboard v2 and Universal Dashboard v3. The intent of Universal Dashboard v2 is to enable users of PowerShell Universal Dashboard to easily run their existing dashboards within PowerShell Universal. Only bug fixes will be going into UDv2. Universal Dashboard v3 is built on a more modern framework and will be receiving feature updates going forward. 

Both dashboards are open source so you can contribute to the dashboard in terms of bug fixes or features.
