# Development

The [Visual Studio Code extension for PowerShell Universal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ironmansoftware.powershell-universal) provides integration for working with APIs. We recommend you also install the [PowerShell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell).

## Developing APIs

You can add APIs by using the admin console or through the editor in Visual Studio Code.

To add an API in the Admin Console, you can visit `http://localhost:5000/admin/apis` and click Add Endpoint.

Once an `endpoints.ps1` file has been created, you can click the Open Endpoints.ps1 button within the API tree view to view the configuration file for APIs.

The configuration file uses the Universal PowerShell cmdlets to define the endpoints within Universal.

If you created a blank endpoint, it would look something like this.

```text
New-PSUEndpoint -Url "/test" -Endpoint { 
    # Enter your script to process requests.
}
```

If you edit the `endpoints.ps1` file, it will update the API automatically. For example, if I added a new API, it would then appear in the admin console.

```text
New-PSUEndpoint -Url "/test" -Endpoint { 
 "hello"
}

New-PSUEndpoint -Url "/test2" -Endpoint { 
    # Enter your script to process requests.
}
```
