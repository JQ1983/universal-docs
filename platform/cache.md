# Cache

PowerShell Universal provides the ability to use a server-level cache to store data that you use between APIs, Automation and Dashboards. You can configure cache item life times use the `Set-PSUCache` cmdlet in any PowerShell script you run in PowerShell Universal. You can also retrieve items from the cache using `Get-PSUCache`.

Some examples of usages for the cache may be:

* Collecting data with a scheduled job and displaying it within a dashboard
* Collecting data from an API and using it in a job
* Collecting using input from a dashboard and queuing it to run in a scheduled job

## Setting items in the cache

To set items in the cache, you can use `Set-PSUCache`. Items in the cache are serialized to strings using CLIXML and the PowerShell serializer. When you retrieve objects from the cache, they will no longer be live objects.

```text
Set-PSUCache -Key "CurrentDate" -Value (Get-Date)
```

There are three types of cache invalidation techniques you can employ.

### Absolute Expiration

The `AbsoluteExpiration` parameter defines at what time the item in the cache is invalidated.

The follow example invalidates the cache item after 10 minutes.

```text
Set-PSUCache -Key "CurrentDate" -Value (Get-Date) -AbsoluteExpiration (Get-Date).AddMinutes(10)
```

### Absolute Expiration From Now

The `AbsoluteExpirationFromNow` parameter defines when a cache item is invalidated using a TimeSpan rather than a calculated DateTime.

The following cache item is invalidated 1 hour from now.

```text
Set-PSUCache -Key "CurrentDate" -Value (Get-Date) -AbsoluteExpirationFromNow ([TimeSpan]::FromHours(1))
```

### Sliding Expiration

The `SlidingExpiration` parameter allows you to defines the amount of time before the cache item is invalidated. Each time the cache item is accessed, the timer is reset.

The following cache item will be invalidated in 5 minutes. If it's accessed within those 5 minutes, it will be reset for another 5 minutes.

```text
Set-PSUCache -Key "CurrentDate" -Value (Get-Date) -SlidingExpiration ([TimeSpan]::FromMinutes(5))
```

## Getting items from the cache

You can use the `Get-PSUCache` cmdlet to retrieve items from the cache. You simply need to supply the key of the item you wish to retrieve. The deserialized object will be returned from the cmdlet.

```text
Get-PSUCache -Key "CurrentDate"
```
