# Supported Browsers

Universal uses a variety of modern web frameworks and can have issues with older browsers such as Internet Explorer.

The current version of the following web browsers are supported: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge)

{% hint style="info" %}
We make a best effort to support Internet Explorer 11 for Universal Dashboard. IE11 is not supported for the Admin Console. There may be issues with certain components as we do not extensively test each change in IE11. If you desire particular functionality in IE11, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ironmansoftware/powershell-universal).
