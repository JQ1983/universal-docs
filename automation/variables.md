# Variables

Variables allow for the global definition of variables that are available within scripts. You can also import secrets that are also available within scripts or as run as credentials. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Variables are stored in the `variables.ps1` configuration file.
{% endhint %}

## Creating a Variable 

To create a variable, navigate to the Automation / Variables page. Click Add Variable to define a new variable. 

Standard variables are just name \ value pairs of strings. They will be added to your scripts before they are run.

## Creating a Secret Variable

{% hint style="warning" %}
Secret management is currently only supported on Windows. 
{% endhint %}

Secret variables are stored within the selected vault. The value of those variables are never stored within Universal. To define a new secret variable, click Add Variable on the variables page and select the Secret tab. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Values for secrets are stored within the current user's Windows Credential Manager instance. If you change users \(such as running as a service account\), the account will not have access to the previous user's secrets and you will need to add those secrets again.
{% endhint %}

From this dialog, you'll be able to define string and PSCredentials in the specified vault.

## Importing Secret Variables

You can also import pre-existing secrets as variables into Universal. The variable values are not imported but will be looked up during execution. Click the Import Secret button to import secrets. 

## Using Variables

Variables can be used in APIs, Scripts and Dashboards. By default, all variables are automatically imported into an environment. You can reference a variable like you would any other PowerShell variable. The variable will contain the value you set. If you use a secret, it will contain the secret's value.  

```text
$MyVariable
```

You can customize which variables are allowed in an environment by customizing the environments `-Variable` parameter. 

See [Environments](../config/environments.md#variables) for more information.
