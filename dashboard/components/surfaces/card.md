# Card

**Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.**

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

## Simple Card

Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint and remember that cards are entry points to more complex and detailed information.
